# Decision & Risk Analysis: FSA Contributions

## Problem Statement
Flexible Spending Accounts (FSAs) require employees to commit funds under uncertainty.
This model estimates optimal contribution increments given random yearly medical expenses and forefeiture risk.

## Data & Assumptions
- Yearly medical expenses based on simulated medical cost scenarios
- Contribution limits based on FSA policy assumptions 

## Methodology
- Monte Carlo simulation implemented in Microsoft Excel
- One thousand simulated expense scenarios generated per simulation
- Scenario analysis used to compare contribution increments and their respective forefeiture risk

## Key Findings
- ~2 contributions maximized contribution amount and minimized expected forfeiture risk
- Higher contributions increased forfeiture risk without proportional benefit
- Visualized confidence intervals and risk profiles across contrubution frequency amounts

## Tools
Excel (Monte Carlo simulation, scenario analysis, VLOOKUP, TABLE, data visualization)
